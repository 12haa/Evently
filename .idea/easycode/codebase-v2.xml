Define the Layout component\\n2. Accept and render children prop \\n3. Apply shared base styling to wrapper div\\n4. Provide consistent layout for child components\&quot;,\&quot;/constants/index.ts\&quot;:\&quot;This constants/index.ts file exports some reusable constants for an application:\\n\\n- headerLinks - This defines the navigation links that will be displayed in the header/navbar of the app. It\\u0027s an array of objects with label and route properties. This allows the header to be rendered consistently across pages.\\n\\n- eventDefaultValues - This defines the default values for a new event object. It\\u0027s an object with keys matching the expected properties of an event (title, description, dates etc). This provides a standardized empty object that can be used when first creating a new event, before the user has entered any values.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Export reusable constants - The constants are defined and exported so they can be imported and used anywhere in the app. This avoids duplicating values.\\n\\n- Standardize header links - The headerLinks constant ensures all pages use the same navigation structure. \\n\\n- Provide defaults for forms - eventDefaultValues gives forms a standardized empty state to work with before user input.\\n\\n- Avoid hardcoding values - By defining the constants centrally, the values only need to be changed in one place if needed.\\n\\nSo in summary, it centralizes some key reusable values needed across the app to standardize behavior and avoid duplicating code.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
